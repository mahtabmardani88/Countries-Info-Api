# Country Info Application

## Project Requirements

We want you to get excited and be free to build something you are passionate about, but there are some things that we need to see you have mastered. This means there are a few requirements:

<span style="color: red;">1.</span> The app needs to be responsive.

<span style="color: green;">My Project:</span> The app is responsive and works on all devices.

<span style="color: red;">2.</span> The app needs to be a single page application.

<span style="color: green;">My Project:</span> The app is a single page application with one `index.html`.

<span style="color: red;">3.</span> The app needs to interact with an API to grab data.

<span style="color: green;">My Project:</span> The app fetches data from the REST Countries API.

<span style="color: red;">4.</span> The app needs to have loading/error handling for the interaction with the API and needs to show this to the user, not just a console.log.

<span style="color: green;">My Project:</span> The app shows a loading message and handles errors.

<span style="color: red;">5.</span> The app needs some user interaction such that you need to grab different data from the API. So you cannot just grab everything from the API and store it locally with one fetch.

<span style="color: green;">My Project:</span> The user can search for countries and get different data from the API.

<span style="color: red;">6.</span> You are not allowed to do a code-along or tutorial for this project, the goal is for you to build something yourself!

<span style="color: green;">My Project:</span> The code is written by us and is not copied from a tutorial.
